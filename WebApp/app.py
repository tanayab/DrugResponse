    description="""
    This app predicts the **IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration)** value for a given cancer drug and cell line combination.
    The **IC50** indicates how much of a drug is needed to inhibit 50% of the cancer cell activity ‚Äî **lower IC50 implies stronger drug efficacy**.

    üî¨ **Use Case**: Predict the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to targeted drugs using molecular features (SMILES for drugs, gene expression for cell lines).

    üßæ **Inputs**:
    - **Drug**: Select a drug from the list (converted from SMILES structure into graph features).
    - **Cell Line**: Choose a cancer cell line (represented by its gene expression profile).

    The app uses a trained deep learning model combining **GCNs (Graph Convolutional Networks)** and **CNNs** to estimate how effective a drug would be against a specific cancer cell line.

    **IC50 Response Guide:**
    üü¢ **Strong**: High sensitivity to drug (effective at low concentration)
    üü° **Moderate**: Partial response ‚Äî drug shows some effectiveness
    üî¥ **Weak**: Likely resistance ‚Äî requires higher concentration to inhibit cells
    *(Lower IC50 = better drug efficacy)*  
    **Note:** Relative sensitivity is calculated based on the IC50 distribution in this dataset.
